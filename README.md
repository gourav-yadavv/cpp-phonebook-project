# cpp-phonebook-project
A C++ phonebook application for managing and organizing contacts efficiently using AVL Tree (self-balancing tree).
Phonebook with AVL Trees is a command-line application written in C++ that allows you to manage a list of contacts using AVL tree data structure. With the help of AVL trees, the phonebook ensures efficient searching, insertion, deletion, and sorting of contacts.

## Features

- Add a new contact with name, phone number, and birthday
- Delete a contact by name
- Search for a contact by name or phone number
- Perform prefix search to find contacts with a given prefix
- Display all contacts
- Display upcoming birthdays
- Update the phone number or birthday of an existing contact

## AVL Trees

The Phonebook utilizes AVL trees, a self-balancing binary search tree, to store and organize the contacts. AVL trees maintain balance through rotations, which ensures efficient search and insertion operations even in the presence of frequent modifications.
